    /* 
      - Vue Computed properties are like methods but with some difference in comparison to methods.
      - When to use COMPUTED PROPERTIES
          -> need to compose new data from existing data sources
          -> need to reference a value directly in your template
          ->call the same function more than once in your template
      - Vue computed property is a property that calculates and returns a value, rather than just store it.
      - A computed property is used to declaratively describe a value that depends on other values. 
        When we data-bind to a computed property inside the template, Vue knows when to update the DOM when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed.
