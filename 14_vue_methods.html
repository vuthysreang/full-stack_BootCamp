    /* - A Vue method is a function associated with the Vue instance. 
       - Methods are defined inside the `methods` property.
       - When to use METHODS
          -> To call a function when an event happen in the DOM
          -> To call a function from the computed or watchers when something happens in our component.
          -> we need to pass parameters
          --> Methods are especially useful when we need to perform an action and we attach a v-on directive on an element to handle events.
       - so every time an event occurs, that method is called.
       - We can access any of the data properties of the Vue component by using this.propertyName:
