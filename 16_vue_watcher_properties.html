    /* 
      - A Vue watcher allows we to listen to the component data and run whenever a particular property changes
      - We can do so by adding to the watch object a property named as the data property we want to watch over:
      - Basically, if we need to perform some an additional action when a property changes, watchers are the way to go.
        Some use cases are:
          -> Observing a value until it reaches a specific value    
          -> Making an asynchronous API call when a value changes
          -> We donâ€™t need to combine existing data into a new property
